For a long period of time I thought that the moment you find a problem, it's no use talking about it or complaining about it until you find a reasonable solution.
At least that. 

Time and time again I found myself in a situation where I worked on a solution, present it, only to be rejected that "It's not that big of a problem". Or worse, the problem wasn't there anymore. 
Certainly there are other times as well when it failed. 

I learned that it's better to voice your concerns early on, and invite others in finding a solution together. Surely it is important how you frame the problem but other than that, you are done. 
Bonus points:
- others might improve on your idea that turns into a solution
- others might identify a better solution
- nobody finds a problem on the spot, but just initiating the conversation gets a flow of actions going and eventually, think will start changing and improving. The problem disappears. 

Prerequisites? I can think of only one: open people to talk to about the problem.
