In December 2020, two familiar concepts came back to me in full swing: Goals and Budget. 

**Goals** are tremendously useful for keeping you on track. For making sure you are not derailing from your main objectives (which could happen even with the best intentions).
They are also useful for *learning*. If you start learning something without a clear objective - or something precise you want to achieve, you will eventually feel that you are not progressing enough and might quit. 

A **financial budget** on the other hand, has been something I never fully implemented from top to bottom. It turns out, I've been missing out on a lot of good things. I can still think of a couple of situation where you might not need one. But more often than not, it will time well-invested.
