There's no one absolute way of...anything. 

* Of solving a problem. 
* Of managing a team.
* Of hiring.
* Of being happy. 

For each activity, there are multiple points of view that need to be considered. 
If you **know** something works really well for a particular activity, that doesn't necessarily mean that it will apply in other activities, albeit very similar ones. 

Let's say you are really, really good at organising your day. 
Setting aside time for work, personal projects, day-to-day stuff. You got it all figured out. You tested, you learned and you planned everything to a t. 

Does this automatically mean that everything you learned and planned applies 100% to, let's say, your work-day? No!

Some of the things will still apply, but other have to change. And it's alright to keep them separate. If you change one thing for your work-activity, it doesn't mean that you should make the same change in your overall-day. 

It just means they are different. And they require different approaches. Stop looking for a panacea.
